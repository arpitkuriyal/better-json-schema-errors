# Hyperjump - Better JSON Schema Errors

TODO: Write a short description of the package

## Install

This module is designed for node.js (ES Modules, TypeScript) and browsers. It
should work in Bun and Deno as well, but the test runner doesn't work in these
environments, so this module may be less stable in those environments.

### Node.js

```bash
npm install @hyperjump/better-json-schema-errors
```

## Examples and Usage
